## Summary ##
  > Birdwatch does the legwork for identifying recent bird sightings and hotspots, making it easier for birding novist and veterans to descover new birds. We combine user generated timeline with the location of recent sightings along with The Cornell Lab of Ornithology's database to create a trusted source for documented bird sightings. Our users travel to different hotspots on the map to find new and rare birds. They also learn about all the different types of birds in their neighborhood that they might not have known about. We've also integrated a social component that allows folks to share their bird lists with other birding enthusiasts. 

## Problem ##
  > It may be intimidating for beginner birders to get started. We make it easy!

## Solution ##
  > Birdwatch tracks bird sightings as recent as 3 days.

## Quote from You ##

They're everywhere but they pop up unpredictably so you have to stay alert! Birdwatch giving us a head start by mapping out recent sightings.
