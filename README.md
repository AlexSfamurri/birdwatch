  > An app that maps out recent birdsightings.

## Summary ##
  > Birdwatch does the legwork of identifying recent sightings and birding hotspots making it easy for birding novist and veterans to explore. We combine user generated feedback about the location of recent sightings along with The Cornell Lab of Ornithology's database to create a trusted source for documented bird sightings. Our users travel to different habitats to find rare and common birds. They also learn about birds in their community that they might not have otherwise known. We've also a social component that allows folks to share their bird lists with other birding enthusiasts. 

## Problem ##
  > It may be intimidating for beginner birders to get started. 

## Solution ##
  > Birdwatch tracks bird sightings as recent as 3 days. 

## Quote from You ##

## How to Get Started ##

## Customer Quote ##
  > "We had no idea how many birds rare and exotic birds were in our neightborhood. There is a birding hotspot right around the corner from my house where I spotted my first Roseate Spoonbill! They're everywhere but they pop up unpredictably so you have to stay alert! Birdwatch giving us a head start by mapping out recent sightings. I am also happy to have a chance to contribute. By posting where I saw the Roseate Spoonbill, I can make it that much easier for someone else to spot their first Roseate Spoonbill."
