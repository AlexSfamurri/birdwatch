## Summary ##
  > Pokemon Go for birdwatchers! Birdwatch does the legwork of identifying recent bird sightings and hotspots, making it easier for birding novice and veterans to discover new birds. We combine crowd generated feedback along with The Cornell Lab of Ornithology's eBird API to create a source for documented bird sightings
